# Beeper GUI

This application utilizes your motherboard to play beeps as music.
If your motherboard doesn't natively support it, then you will instead hear the Windows emulation.

## Hotkeys:

a/b/c/d/e/f/g/r - select that note (r = rest note)
s - select sharp of current note (if possible)
enter - add current note
' - add breath mark
space - play/pause music
delete - remove currently selected note (bugged somehow... sometimes works...)
backspace - removes last note (works 100%)
up/down arrow - change octave (only if checkbox is highlighted)

Alt + w/d/h/q/e/s/t - select that length

Ctrl + O - Open a beep file
Ctrl + S - Save a file as...
Ctrl + C - Clear all notes
Ctrl + Q - Quit program
Ctrl + K - Open keyboard
